== NodePresenter

NodePresenter is a very small app that combines the awesome http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/ project, http://nodejs.org/ and http://socket.io/ to allow remote control of your jmpress presentations. 


== Getting Started

1. First install the dependencies 
       npm install .

2. Fire up the app 
       node app.js

3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see a sample presentation:
  

4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your mobile browser (or desktop browser for that matter) where you need to replace localhost with your machines ip, to see the remote.

5. If your device supports ondeviceorientation you can tip it from side to side to trigger slide changes.


-- Development

This is very much a hobby but I hope it will be usefull to someone.
